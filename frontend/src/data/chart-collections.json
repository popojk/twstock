Yields on Treasury securities at constant maturity are determined by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve. That is based on the closing market-bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. How it's used: This figure is used as a reference point to establish the price of other securities such as corporate bonds. Treasury securities are considered risk-free since they are backed by the U.S. government. This figure, and an added margin based upon the risk involved, is used in pricing various debt securities.",
